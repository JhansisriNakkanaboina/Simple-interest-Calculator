I made a Simple Interest Calculator. It operates on a straightforward principle, considering a fixed rate of 2 rupees for every 100 rupees as the interest rate per month. The calculator efficiently determines the time difference in terms of months and days between the provided start and end dates. Leveraging this information, it accurately calculates the simple interest on the given principal amount. The user-friendly interface ensures ease of use, making it a valuable tool for quick simple financial calculations.
